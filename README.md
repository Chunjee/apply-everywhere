# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is "apply everywhere"? What do you mean by challenge?
Great question! Apply everywhere is a challenge where you try to mazimize your chances of an internship or full time job offer
by _literally applying everywhere._ The job listings are ones where you can submit an application in less than 5 mins, meaning 
being able to get the most for the least time. Applying to jobs are hard, but hopefully by applying to more places you can increase
your chance of landing that sweet summer or fulltime gig. 

The challenge is to apply everywhere, but the best applicants apply to the roles best fit for them. So, do apply everywhere
but also make sure it is for a job you want. 

## How are jobs added?
It's me! When I find jobs that have short, painless applications I'll add them to the challenge. I don't know all the jobs, so if 
you know of any jobs, please submit a pull request and I'll add that listing in! 

## How is this maintained? 
I try to update this a couple times a week, but it depends on what job listings I find that week. 

## I got a job through this challenge! Can I tell you about it?
Omg, yes please!! I'd love to know how this helped you! Please, please send me an [email](mailto:abchen@uw.edu)!
